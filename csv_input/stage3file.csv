This issue impacts productivity and potentially delays important HR workflows such as approvals payroll processing or timesheet submissions. The incident has been logged for further investigation. The support team has escalated this as part of the L1-L5 triage process and prioritized it based on business impact. For 'Authentication' it is crucial to ensure stability because it plays a central role in employee operations. Recommended next steps include replicating the issue in a test environment validating against different roles and verifying recent patch deployments. Testing should include both automated regression and manual edge case verification. Logs and screenshots where applicable are to be gathered and attached. An assigned engineer or team is responsible for tracking and resolving this issue in the upcoming sprint cycle. Resolution notes and patches will be validated by QA before final closure. Mitigation steps may include disabling the affected functionality temporarily or providing manual override capabilities to avoid blocking critical workflows. Communications should be sent to stakeholders and impacted users once the root cause and fix are confirmed. Documentation and help articles must be updated to reflect the resolution and prevent recurrence. Overall resolving this defect will improve system reliability and enhance user confidence in the HRM system.","Medium","In Progress","UI","01-06-2025","Alice","28-05-2025","C"
